## 002 Service and Event Based Architecture
The solution will utilize Service and Event Based Architecture

### Status
ACCEPTED

### Context
The solution shall narrow down the number of utilized architectures to spare resources - limit complexity and cost.

### Decision
Based on the architectural characteristics Service and Event based architectures were chosen as the most suitable. 

### Consequences
The decision seems to be well balanced between the extremes.


##### PROS:
It will provide high modularization, separation of duty and deployment, easy extensibility and maintainability. Less effor than microservices architecture, more flexibility than monolithic ones. 

##### CONS:
Will consume more resources to implement and design than a monolithic architecture.
