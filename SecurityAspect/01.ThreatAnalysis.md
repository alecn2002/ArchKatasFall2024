# Threat Analysis

## Security Objectives

* Ensure the confidentiality of users' private data and payment information.
* Maintain the integrity of the data to prevent unauthorized modifications.
* Ensure the availability of the system to authorized users.

## Assets

### Primary assets defined by business logic

* **Full CV** - highly sensitive, contains personal data. Shall not leak outside in no way.
    * Shall be stored encrypted
    * Shall be transferred encrypted
    * Shall be processed in Trusted Execution Environment(s)
* **Payments** - shall be protected against malicious Employers
* **System Availability**

### Secondary assets produced by other assets protection development

* Users credentials 
    * Job seeker credentials
    * Internal users (Admin, etc.) credentials
    * Employer users credentials
* Peer systems identification credentials:
    * Employers' HR systems
    * Payment system(s)
    * AI providers
* Authorization data (World readable)

## Adversaries

* Job seekers - remote only, different levels
* Employers' personnel - remote only, low to mid level
* Internal - remote and physical access, low to mid level
* Other (maybe registered as job seekers) - remote, up to highest level

<!-- 
To generate a comprehensive threat model for a system that maintains and processes users' CVs containing private data and information about payments from employers, we will follow the steps outlined in the context. Here is the detailed threat model:

1. Security Objectives
Ensure the confidentiality of users' private data and payment information.
Maintain the integrity of the data to prevent unauthorized modifications.
Ensure the availability of the system to authorized users.
2. Key Usage Scenarios
Users upload their CVs to the system.
Employers access the system to view CVs and process payments.
System administrators manage the system and ensure its security.
3. Security Protection Mechanisms
Encryption of data at rest and in transit.
Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
Data integrity checks and logging of all access and modifications.
4. Data Flows and Security Mechanism Flows
Input: Users upload CVs, employers submit payment information.
Output: Employers download CVs, users receive payment confirmations.
Entry Points: User login, employer login, admin login, CV upload, payment submission.
Exit Points: CV download, payment confirmation.
5. Security Threats and Vulnerabilities
Unauthorized access to private data.
Data breaches due to weak encryption.
Insider threats from disgruntled employees.
Phishing attacks targeting users and employers.
SQL injection attacks on the database.
6. Threats Along Data Flows and Security Mechanism Flows
Input: Unauthorized upload of malicious files.
Output: Unauthorized download of sensitive data.
Entry Points: Brute force attacks on login pages, exploitation of weak passwords.
Exit Points: Data exfiltration through compromised accounts.
